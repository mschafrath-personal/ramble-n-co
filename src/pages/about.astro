    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      Ramble & Co. is a creative consulting practice focused on designing workflows that help teams think clearly and execute with confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Led by Mary Schafrath, the work blends a foundation in visual design with deep experience in UX research operations, systems thinking, and cross-functional enablement. The focus is not just on what teams build—but on the structures that support good decisions along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Typical engagements include early problem framing, UX and content structure, and operational tooling such as workflows, templates, and internal systems. The goal is simple: reduce noise, create alignment, and make progress feel calmer.
