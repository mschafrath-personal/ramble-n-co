    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      Ramble & Co. is a small consulting + creative studio. We partner with teams
      to bring clarity to complex work — from early problem framing to practical
      systems that help teams move faster with less friction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Typical engagements include lightweight strategy, UX and content
      structure, and operational tooling (templates, workflows, and
      enablement). The goal is simple: make decisions easier and execution
      calmer.
